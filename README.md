# Ptolemy’s Theorem — A Visual Meditation

An interactive canvas-based visualization of Ptolemy’s Theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals.

Four points lie on a fixed circle and can be dragged along it. As the quadrilateral changes, the identity

$\mathrm{AB \cdot CD + BC \cdot DA = AC \cdot BD}$

is verified numerically in real time.

This project prioritizes clarity, geometry-first design, and restraint over animation or effects.

## Status
- Geometry and interaction complete
- Numerical verification complete
- Visual styling in progress
- Math rendering (KaTeX / MathJax) planned
